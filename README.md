## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm MetaMask Guide ðŸ¦Š Luigi: [metamask.io/u/luigi](https://community.metamask.io/u/luigi)

A proud MetaMask Community member for over 4 years, I've achieved 'Leader' trust level by consistently offering honest advice and guidance to fellow users.
I publish various programs here to assist MetaMask wallet users in resolving common issues.

For instance, if you forget a single word of your seed phrase, you can utilize my program: [One Word Finder](https://github.com/0xLuigi/one-word-finder-for-metamask).

If you need to locate vault data within a file, you can try my program: [MetaMask Vault Finder](https://github.com/0xLuigi/metamask-vault-finder).

[SQL MetaMask ID Viewer](https://github.com/0xLuigi/sql-metamask-id-viewer) is a GUI tool designed to help resolve MetaMask wallet startup issues in Firefox by allowing you to view and copy wallet database IDs.

Rest assured, my tools contain no backdoors or stupids viruses; however, for maximum security, please use them offline and on a dedicated, secure computer.

**PS: If you are interested in a similar tool for another crypto wallet or have any questions regarding my tools, feel free to contact me on Telegram: https://t.me/Luigi_SK, and we can definitely discuss it.**
